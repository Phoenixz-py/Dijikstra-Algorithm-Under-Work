# Dijikstra-Algorithm
If you have been keeping up with my work you have seen I usually use promptSync NPM to get user inputs easily and I imported chalk NPM too
Chalk is npm of decoration, I use it so it doesn't hurt my eyes after staring at a screen for a long and ofc everyone likes beauty.
I have saved strings in constant variables with const so my code looks neat below
Later I made a class EDGE to make a constructor that constructs the logical graph I have represented with the console. table later stages of my code
A graph consists of Edges, Weight, and many other things, I called a constructor to create new objects and saved them in a const array called edge
Later I used the filter method on the array to make sure the start vertex is Edge 1

I took an empty variable controlEdge I will tell its uses 
And I took keyEdgeManipulator = 100 for later uses
I used for loop to scan the array, im doing it to assign weight to the graph if u see it you will realize and made a big function Calc, basically trying to code the Dijkstra algorithm. I put here all the theoretical knowledge I learned in my class
Im not going to xplain that, as you should already know the algo but u can conctant me if you want to understand and later used if else if else conditions to get desired shortest path and later just called my function



The intro isnt that good, my head hurts. I will update it someday but not today
